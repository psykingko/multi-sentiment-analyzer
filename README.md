# Multi-Sentiment Analyzer

## üöÄ Overview

Multi-Sentiment Analyzer is a cutting-edge, multi-modal platform for analyzing sentiment and emotion from text, voice, and facial expressions. It combines rule-based and deep learning AI models, offers exportable reports, and features SoulSync‚Äîan AI-powered therapeutic companion.

## üåü Features

- **Text & Paragraph Insights:** Analyze sentiment and emotion in any text, from single sentences to full paragraphs.
- **Real-Time Face Emotion Analysis:** Detect emotions from facial expressions using your webcam (rule-based and deep learning options).
- **Voice & Video Input:** Analyze spoken emotions and facial cues live.
- **Flexible AI Models:** Toggle between lightning-fast rule-based (VADER, TextBlob, geometric rules) and advanced deep learning (DistilBERT, face-api.js) models.
- **Exportable Reports:** Download detailed PDF reports of your sentiment and emotion analysis.
- **Data Privacy & Security:** All data is encrypted; no personal data is stored. Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at the database level.
- **SoulSync AI Support:** Chat with SoulSync, an AI companion for supportive, mindful conversation using evidence-based therapy techniques (CBT, DBT, ACT) and crisis detection.
- **In-Depth Analytics:** Comprehensive breakdowns and trends for every analysis, including animated stats and user insights.
- **User Authentication & History:** Secure login via Supabase, with personal analysis history and insights.
- **RESTful API:** Integrate sentiment analysis into your own apps or services.
- **Experimental Features:** Voice and face analysis for demonstration only (not for medical use). SoulSync is experimental and not a licensed therapist.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd multi_sentiment_analyzer
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### a. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### b. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### c. Environment Variables
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (e.g., database URL, Gemini API key).

#### d. Database Setup
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
- Run the schema:
```bash
psql <your-db-connection-string> -f ../database/schema.sql
```

#### e. Download NLTK and TextBlob corpora (first run only)
```bash
python download_nltk.py
```

#### f. Start the backend server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## üß† Deep Learning Text Analysis ("Deep" Mode)

By default, the deep learning model for text sentiment analysis (DistilBERT/DistilRoBERTa) is **not hosted** due to resource constraints. To use deep mode locally:

### 1. Install Additional Dependencies
These are now included in `backend/requirements.txt`:
- `transformers`
- `torch`

If you need to install manually:
```bash
pip install transformers torch sentencepiece
```

### 2. Download the Model (First Use)
The first time you run deep mode, the HuggingFace Transformers library will automatically download the model (`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`). Ensure your machine has internet access and enough disk space (~500MB).

### 3. Enable Deep Learning Mode
Set the environment variable in your `.env`:
```
ENABLE_DEEP_LEARNING=true
```

Restart the backend server. Now, when you select "deep" mode in the UI, the backend will use the deep learning model for text analysis.

**Note:** Deep mode requires more RAM and CPU. For production, consider hosting the model on a GPU server or using a managed inference API.

## üîí Security & Privacy
- All user data is encrypted in transit.
- No personal data is stored unless you log in and save your analysis.
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.
- SoulSync is an experimental AI companion, not a licensed therapist. For urgent mental health needs, seek professional help.

## üì¶ API Usage

The backend exposes a RESTful API for integration. Example endpoints:
- `POST /analyze` ‚Äî Analyze text for sentiment/emotion
- `POST /soulsync/chat` ‚Äî Chat with SoulSync AI
- `GET /insights` ‚Äî Get global analysis stats

See the code for request/response formats.
